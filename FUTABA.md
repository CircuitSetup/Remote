9) Remove four silver screws (7) around the antenna, and pull out antenna as far as the wire permits
10) Remove two silver screws on the top of the main PCB
11) Remove five ribbon cables on the main PCB
12) Lift main PCB; at this point, it is held by only pin sockets that connect it to other PCBs; you can't pull it out entirely because it is connected to other parts by wires.

Now you can access the potentiometer to patch in black-green-red wires in order to connect this pot to the kit's Control Board, as well as all switches and buttons you may want to connect to said Control board.
