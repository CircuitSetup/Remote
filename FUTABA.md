5) Remove two black screws (5) on the front, in the outer corners of the lever controls, and note which screw goes into which hole (they are different)

6) Remove four black screws (6) on the bottom

7) Pull out side parts
8) Remove four silver screws around the antenna, and pull out antenna as far as the wire permits
9) Remove two silver screws on the top of the main PCB
10) Remove five ribbon cables on the main PCB
11) Lift main PCB (at this point, it is held by only pin sockets that connect it to other PCBs)

Now you can access the potentiometer to patch in black-green-red wires in order to connect this pot to the kit's Control Board, as well as all switches and buttons you may want to connect to said Control board.
