### How to take apart the Futaba remote control

The following instructions only apply to the movie-accurate models FP-T8SGA-P and FP-T8SGH-P.

1) Remove the cover of the adjustment panel (1) on the back
2) Remove the transmitter module (2); it is held by two clips at top and bottom
3) Remove the four silver screws (3) on the back and remove back cover

4) Remove four black screws (4) on the adjustment panel, and remove the bezel

5) Remove two black screws (5) on the front, in the outer corners of the lever controls, and note which screw goes into which hole (they are different)

6) Remove four black screws (6) on the bottom

7) Pull out side parts; the small switch panels can be pulled out of the side parts easily.

9) Remove four silver screws (7) around the antenna, and pull out antenna as far as the wire permits
10) Remove two silver screws on the top of the main PCB
11) Remove five ribbon cables on the main PCB
12) Lift main PCB; at this point, it is held by only pin sockets that connect it to other PCBs; you can't pull it out entirely because it is connected to other parts by wires.

Now you can access the potentiometer to patch in black-green-red wires in order to connect this pot to the kit's Control Board, as well as all switches and buttons you may want to connect to said Control board.

### Pot connection

Desolder the red/green/black wires from the pot an attach new ones to connect the pot to the Control Board. The connector on the Control Board is marked R, G, Bk, matching the original wire colors.

Please note that the kit electronics are designed for models FP-T8SGA-P and FP-T8SGH-P, which use a 5k pot and resistancies of 1.8k through 3k for the throttle. If you are using a different model, the electronics might need modifications. Please contact us for more information.

### Button/switch connections

If you want to wire switches from the Futaba remote control to the Control Board, it is recommended to use a common GND wire. This GND wire connects all center pins of all switches to each other and the GND screw connector on the Control Board.

Some of the switches on the Futaba are interconnected, such as the ones on top, right hand side (when viewed from the front). Check the traces of the PCBs, desoldering or cutting-off components or wire bridges might be required. The switches must be working independingly, otherwise proper operation might be hindered.

Do not re-connect the wide ribbon cables to the main PCB when re-assembling the remote; other parts of the original circuit might interfere with switch operation.

### Wires

The wires need to lead out of the Futaba's body. One way to do this is to dremel off the back cover a bit to make room, as shown in the picture. This requires bending the top part of the inner shielding upward to make room for the wires in the corners.
