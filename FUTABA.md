## How to take apart the Futaba remote control

1) Remove the lid on the back
2) Remove the four silver screws on the back and remove back plate
3) Remove four black screws on the adjustment panel, and remove this panel
4) Remove two black screws on the front, in the outer corners of the lever controls, and note which screw goes into which hole (they are different)
5) Remove four black screws on the bottom
6) Pull out side parts
7) Remove four silver screws around the antenna, and pull out antenna as far as the wire permits
8) Remove two silver screws on the top of the main PCB
9) Remove five ribbon cables on the main PCB
10) Lift main PCB (it is held by pin sockets that connect it to other PCBs)

Now you can access the potentiometer to patch in black-green-red wires to connect this pot to the kit's Control Board, as well as all switches and buttons you may want to connect to said Control board.
